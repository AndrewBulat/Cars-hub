    <div>Legally, most states have time-based rules for the definition of "historic" or "classic" for purposes <br>
       such as antique vehicle registration. For example, Maryland defines historic vehicles as 20 calendar years <br>
       old or older and they "must not have been substantially altered, remodeled or remanufactured from the <br>
        manufacturers original design"[6] while West Virginia defines motor vehicles manufactured at least 25 <br>
         years prior to the current year as eligible for "classic" car license plates.Despite this, at many American <br>
          classic car shows, automobiles typically range from the 1920s to the 1970s. Recently, many 1980s and <br>
          even early 1990s cars are considered being "classic automobiles". Examples of cars at such shows include <br>
           the Chevrolet Bel-Air, Ford Model T, Dodge Charger, Ford Deuce Coupe, and 1949 Ford. Meanwhile, the <br>
           Concours d'Elegance car shows feature prestigious automobiles such as the Cadillac V16 or pre-1940 <br>
           Rolls-Royce models. There are also terms as "modern customs", "exotics", or "collectibles" that cover <br>
           cars such as the AMC Gremlin or Ford Pinto. <br> </div>
